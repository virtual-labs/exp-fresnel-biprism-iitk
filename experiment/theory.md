In the case of bi-prism experiment the mean wavelength<br>
<img src="images/fig5.PNG"><br><br>
&lambda;= &omega;. 2d/D <br><br>
Where,  &omega; = fringe width<br>
              2d = distance between the two virtual sources<br>
               D = distance between the slit and the eyepiece<br>
Distanced between the virtual sources is given by 2d = âˆš (d1.d2)<br>
Where,<br>
              d1 = distance between the two image formed by the convex lens in the first position.<br>
              d2 = distance between the two image formed by the convex lens in the second position
