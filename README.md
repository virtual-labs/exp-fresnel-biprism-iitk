<b> Experiment|     <b> 4. Measurement of the wavelength of monochromatic source of light with the help of Fresnel’s Bi prism

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5> <br>

In the case of bi-prism experiment the mean wavelength
lemda = w*(2d/D)

Where,  w = fringe width
              2d = distance between the two virtual sources
               D = distance between the slit and the eyepiece
Distanced between the virtual sources is given by 2d = √ (d1.d2)
Where,
              d1 = distance between the two image formed by the convex lens in the first position.
              d2 = distance between the two image formed by the convex lens in the second position
