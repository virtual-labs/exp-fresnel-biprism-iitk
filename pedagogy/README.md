#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Student will identify the relation between wavelength of the light source and the fringe width of the fringe pattern for the bi prism. | Student will complete introduction. He will be given 4 images for the relation between wavelength of the light source and the fringe width of the fringe pattern for the bi-prism and will choose correct image from them. | Choose the correct image for the relation between wavelength of the light source and the fringe width of the fringe pattern for the bi prism: <img src="images/fre.png"><br>a)A<br>b)B<br>c)C<br>d)D
2.| To enable the student to describe the methodology to find the value of distance between two virtual sources created by bi-prism. | Student will be given 4 images for the correct procedure to be followed in the experiment. He will choose correct image from them. | Choose the correct image for the relation between wavelength of the light source and the fringe width of the fringe pattern for the bi prism: <img src="images/fre1.png"><br>a)image1<br>b)image2<br>c)image3<br>d)image4
3.| Student will be able to Predict the fringe  | Student will make experimental set up followed by taking  | On increasing the wavelength of the light source  keeping 2d and D fixed the fringe width:<br>a) Increases<br>b) decreases<br>c)remains constant<br>d) NOT
4.| Student will examine the values of mean fringe width, 2d and D and calculate the value of mean wavelength of the light source. | Student will take observations for 2d and D | The value of 2d is related with d1 and d2 according to the relation:<br> A. 2d = √ (d1.d2) <br> B. 2d = √ (d1/d2) <br> C. 2d = d1. √ d2 <br> D. Option 2d = √ d1+d2 <br> 
5.| Conclude the mean wavelength of the light source. | Students will calculate the mean wavelength of the light source. | The wavelength of the light used in the Fresnel’s bi prism experiment is: <br> A. 5896 A<sup>0</sup> <br> B. 6000 A<sup>0</sup> <br> C. 6896 A<sup>0</sup> <br> D. 8596 A<sup>0</sup> <br>

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Simulator will allow student to make experimental set up and will alert him in case of wrong setup made. | Student will slide the power button of the simulator to ON position.  | To initiate the simulator
2.| Simulator will show the green light indicating that the simulator is ready for use.  | Student will fix the positions of light source, bi-prism and Screen.  | To obtain measureable fringes on the screen.
3.| Simulator will show fringes formed on the screen with the scale to measure the fringes formed.  | Student will measure the fringe width, distance between the virtual sources created and the distance between the source and the screen and mention these values in the table.  | To get the values of fringe width, distance between the virtual sources created and the distance between the source and the screen
4.| Simulator will calculate values required in the table. | Student will press calculate wavelength button  | To calculate the wavelength of the light used.
5.| Simulator will calculate the wavelength of the light used.| Student will change the light source and will repeat the experiment  | Student will again note the value of wavelength of the light used calculate the percentage error with the standard value.
