#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Student will identify the relation between wavelength of the light source and the fringe width of the fringe pattern for the bi prism. | Student will complete introduction. He will be given 4 images for the relation between wavelength of the light source and the fringe width of the fringe pattern for the bi-prism and will choose correct image from them. | Choose the correct image for the relation between wavelength of the light source and the fringe width of the fringe pattern for the bi prism: <img src="images/fre.png"><br>a)A<br>b)B<br>c)C<br>d)D
2.| To enable the student to describe the methodology to find the value of distance between two virtual sources created by bi-prism. | Student will be given 4 images for the correct procedure to be followed in the experiment. He will choose correct image from them. | Choose the correct image for the relation between wavelength of the light source and the fringe width of the fringe pattern for the bi prism: <img src="images/fre1.png"><br>a)image1<br>b)image2<br>c)image3<br>d)image4
3.| Student will be able to Predict the fringe  | Student will make experimental set up followed by taking  | On increasing the wavelength of the light source  keeping 2d and D fixed the fringe width:<br>a) Increases<br>b) decreases<br>c)remains constant<br>d) NOT
